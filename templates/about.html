    <!-- ===================== OUR HISTORY ====================== -->
    <div class="about-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">🏡 Our History</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            The Thendral Youth Association was founded in 1996 by a dedicated group of young people and elders
            from the beautiful village of Christian Pet. Most villagers were farmers, united by hard work, love, and a
            strong desire to uplift their community.
            <br><br>
            The founding purpose of this association was clear:
            <b>“Progress through Unity, Change through Love.”</b>
            <br><br>
            What began as small efforts — village cleaning, tree planting, streetlight installation, educational support,
            and awareness programs — soon grew into a powerful community movement.

            <p class="about-text">
                Christian Pet is a village blessed with natural beauty and warm-hearted people.  
                Its residents, mostly farmers, have passed down their values of hard work, unity, and compassion.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, the younger generations have excelled in education and now shine across Europe, America,
                Canada, and the Middle East in various professions.
                Christian Pet today stands as a model village of “double development” and a symbol of unity and progress.
